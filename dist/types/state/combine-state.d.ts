/**
 * Merges a list of Redux state objects (which may be undefined). Returns undefined if all arguments are undefined.

 *
 * Main differences to Object.assign() are that combineState()
 * (1) does not modify its first argument,
 * (2) accepts undefined for all arguments.
 *
 * @param state the Redux state objects to combine
 * @return the combined Redux state objects or undefined if all arguments are undefined
